# Licon

## Overview

**Licon** is a simple, useful and lightness pack—icon that made with Pure CSS3 by [Siamak Mokhtari](http://twitter.com/sia_mac) at [FictionTeam](http://twitter.com/fictionteam) in [Tehran, Iran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran). It has [Sass](http://github.com/siamakmokhtari/licon/sass/) version so it can easily be modified and merged into modern projects. It provides all the useful icons for good design without adding any images or fonts. Also you can add effects of Animate.css on Licon. I hope that it's useful for your projects.

## Syntax

You should set `licon.sass` with your projects and compile it. include `licon.css` file into your projects.
For Example: 
Here's an example:

```html
<link href="styles/licon.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```
